libdivsufsort
=============

The initial upload of this package uses the tarball
distributed from the traditional google code repository.
The maintainer is aware of the transition to github,
however, that reimpor has issues with the build 
instructions, while otherwise being functionally identical.

For NMUs or team uploads, or whenever a migration to
the github tarball seems appropriate, please inspect a
espective pull request on
https://github.com/y-256/libdivsufsort/pull/7
